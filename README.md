✅ Project Steps
1. Environment Setup
Tools Used: VS Code, Python 3.8+, MySQL, PostgreSQL

Goal: Structured and modular workspace for data loading, transformation, and querying.

2. Kaggle API Setup
Download your kaggle.json API token from your Kaggle profile.

Place it in your ~/.kaggle/ folder.

Download dataset using:

bash
Copy
Edit
kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>
3. Download Dataset
Source: Walmart Sales Dataset on Kaggle

Save data to the /data directory.

4. Install Required Libraries
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
5. Load and Explore Data
Load into Pandas using .read_csv().

Explore with .info(), .describe(), .head().

6. Data Cleaning
Remove duplicates

Handle missing values

Convert data types (e.g., datetime, float)

Format currency columns

Validate cleaned output

7. Feature Engineering
Add TotalAmount = UnitPrice * Quantity

Create additional columns for time-based analysis if required.

8. Load into MySQL & PostgreSQL
Use SQLAlchemy to connect to databases.

Automate table creation and data insertion.

Verify via simple SQL queries.

9. SQL Analysis & Business Insights
Run SQL queries to answer questions like:

📈 Sales trends by branch and category

🛍 Top-selling product lines

🏙 Branch-level performance and profitability

🕒 Time-based analysis (peak hours, days)

💰 Payment method preferences

All SQL queries are stored in /sql_queries/

📊 Results and Insights
Sales Performance: Highest sales from Branch A, peak during weekends.

Product Category: Health and Electronics lead in revenue.

Customer Trends: E-Wallet is the most preferred payment method.

Time Insights: Peak shopping occurs during early evenings.

💡 Future Enhancements
Integrate with Power BI or Tableau for dashboard visualization.

Add real-time pipeline using streaming tools.

Connect more datasets (e.g., inventory or customer feedback).
